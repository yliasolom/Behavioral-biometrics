Visual surveillance has exponentially increased the growth of security devices and systems in the digital era. Gait- and face-recognition-based person identification is an emerging biometric modality for automatic visual surveillance and monitoring as the walking patterns highly correlate to the subjectâ€™s identity. The scientific research on person identification using gait and low-resolution face has grown dramatically over the past two decades due to its several benefits. It does not require active collaboration from users and can be performed without their cooperation.

A face and & identification program intended to detect & identify faces from pictures that are of size 30x30 pixels using EDSR image super-resolution, whereas gait recognition
The input for gait recognition is a set of silhouettes (there are NOT ANY constrains on an input, which means it can contain any number of non-consecutive silhouettes filmed under different viewpoints with different walking conditions).
